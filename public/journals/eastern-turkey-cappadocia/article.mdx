Two years ago, I traveled to Armenia where I discovered beautiful scenery and where I was always welcomed with open arms. Back in Belgium, I got interested in the neighboring countries of Armenia. Therefor I visited Georgia in the summer of 2014. It confirmed my feelings about the Caucasus region.

In may 2015, I found myself again on the plane to Tbilisi, Georgia. Something told me I had to go back to this city. Iâ€™m happy I did. The city has not so many secrets left for me know.

After two days in Tbilisi I traveled to Batumi by train. From Batumi, I traveled by mini bus to the Turkish border. The journal about Eastern Turkey will start in Hopa. The first city in Turkey coming from the border with Georgia.
