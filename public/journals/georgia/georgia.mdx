My journey to Armenia last year has left me with such a great memories I could do nothing than go back this year. However, I also wanted to discover new regions in the first place. That’s how I decided to make an extended journey combining Georgia and Armenia. Focussing on exploring Georgia – where the trip starts – and meet some old friends in Armenia at the end of the trip.

Note: Currently the last days of this trip in Armenia are not yet covered in this journal. Please have a look at my previous journal of Armenia if you are interested in Armenia.
