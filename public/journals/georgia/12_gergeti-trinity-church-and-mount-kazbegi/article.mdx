We were camping together with a bunch of other hikers and mountain climbers in the grass field around the Gergeti Trinity Church. I was told to wake up before sunrise when camping at the Gergeti Trinity Church. So we did. My alarm clock was set at 6am. Why would we do this? To see the most wonderful sunrise I had ever seen. The summit of Mount Kazbegi catches the first sun beams.

When the sun reaches the top of the mountain range on the other side, the light falls on the Gergeti Trinity Church.

Now that we were awake, we packed the tent and started walking to Mount Kazbegi. Of course we were not going to climb this 5.033 m high mountain. Our goal of our hike was to reach a glacier.
The first two hours is a very steep walk to get over the first pass. But it’s definitely worth it. You’ll get a great view on Mount Kazbegi and the glacier.

The glacier seems to be at the same altitude so the hardest part of our hike is done. It took us about one other hour to reach the glacier. Just before we reached the glacier, there were already some nice views on the glacier and into the depth.

People who are going to climb Mount Kazbegi need to cross the glacier and spend the night in or around the Betlemi Hut that’s serving as a mountain climbers’ shelter. There, they’ll need one day for training and acclimatization and another day to climb to the top and get back to the shelter.

We just had our picnic in front of the glacier and returned back to the car at the Gergeti Trinity Church.

With this walk we ended our journey around the Georgian Military Highway and we drove back to Mtscheta. A small town at the start of the Georgian Military Highway. Mtskheta is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The “Historical Monuments of Mtskheta” became a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1994.

We asked around for a place to stay for the night and finally ended in a homestay after we declined the offers to stay in a hotel. The city is great for a small evening walk. The locals gather around the walls of the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral and create a gentle atmosphere.

In the north-east side of the city, there is a big new restaurant but I prefered the cosy bar/restaurant a little bit further north in the same street. There is a family atmosphere and you can sit outside under the trees. I had the traditional Georgian Khinkali.
