Today we left Tbilisi. We were heading for the Georgian Military Highway to get into the higher Caucasus. Before we got the the highway, we still visited Jrapi Monastery from where we got a stunning view on Mtskheta.

From the monastery, a very rough track goes steeply down to the Georgian Military Highway. There are several points of interest along this road and will eventually cross the border with Russia.

Most people get on the bus and drive straight to Stepantsminda. The last city before the Russian border and also the base city for those who want to climb Mount Kazbegi. However, I would definitely recommend spending at least two days to get to Stepantsminda. Leave the main road a few times and drive/hike deeper into the Caucasus. I hope the photographs below can somewhat convince you to do so.

We hope to reach the village of Kobi. But we didn’t want to risk getting in trouble with the dog that was waiting ahead on the path. So we returned to our car and continued driving up the Georgian Military Highway. We camped together with some cows near Kanobi (42.583302, 44.524041) close to the river. There was a water source available as well.
