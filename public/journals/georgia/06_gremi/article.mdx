My time in Tusheti is running out. Around 11am, Leo will bring be back to Telavi. I didn’t plan anything today. Just have a calm morning with the people of The Green House. The Green House guesthouse and cafe changed a lot while I was there. Unfortunately, I couldn’t see the final result. Anyway I can recommend to stay at the Green House guesthouse. Leo is very helpful and knows everything about Tusheti. He can arrange anything for you. Transport, accommodation, food, hiking, horseriding, … Altough they aim for tourists, I never felt a tourist at the green house. Leo told me I’m their friend. That’s definitely true!

One of the workers, Shota, joined Leo and me for the car ride to Telavi. During the ride he told me I should definitely visit Gremi. It was close to his hometown Eniseli so I joined we could take the same bus from Telavi. He also joined me on my visit of this stunning citadel.

When I saw the whole citadel – inclusive the whine cellars – he invited me to visit his family. Although I planned to camp somewhere in the wild that night. I decided to meet his family. A good decision! His mother makes delicious Khinkali!
