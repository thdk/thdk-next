My last full day in Tusheti. I left The Green House in the early morning. It was just 7am when I reached the pass at the top of Omalo. Beautiful view with the sun rising over lower Omalo.

The path to Dartlo isnâ€™t very spectacular, but I did enjoyed the walk. Especially the fresh morning air and the low sun made it a pleasant walk. I just loved the deep shadows on the mountains drawn by the low position of the sun.

The path is easy, but longâ€¦ Fortunately, it mostly goes down. The path has to cross the river at some point. And indeed, the river became audible and there was the bridge. I didnâ€™t cross the bridge immediately. Instead, I took a small path left before the bridge to get a better view on Dartlo.

I avoided the most obvious hotel/restaurant and found a small cafe in one of the little alleys of the village. I was the only customer. When I had finished my lunch, I met some Russian people who went fishing in the river. I joined them for an hour when I realized they didnâ€™t knew how to fish. I didnâ€™t knew either, so I couldnâ€™t help them and decided to start walking back to Omalo.

For the first climb I managed again to catch a ride. It wasnâ€™t the most comfortable one, but it saved me a lot of valuable time in Tusheti. In the early afternoon I arrived back in Omalo. After I had some rest, Shota took me for a small walk in Omalo. I thought I had seen Omalo already since I was living there for three days now and itâ€™s really small, but apparently I missed one part of the village.

I wasnâ€™t planning to stay all the time at the same base camp in Tusheti. Luckily I met the right people to change my mind. The Green House is really a perfect basecamp to explore Tusheti. I was happy to have a place to come home in these mountains. There was good company in the evenings and I didnâ€™t had to take care of food. I really miss the life at The Green House in Omalo.
