I’ve always been curious about this country but only now I finally traveled to Armenia. It’s not the easiest country to go to since there isn’t many information available and only two guidebooks to choose from. I chose for the Bradt Travel guidebook for Armenia (Bradt Travel Guide).
While reading the Bradt Travel guidebook , my expectations of Armenia where only growing.
So with a lot of expectations, my guidebook and a big backpack I left Belgium for two weeks. To Armenia.
I soon realized Armenia is really worth a visit. You may not believe me now, but you may do after reading my story and watching my photos.
