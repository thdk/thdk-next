About six kilometers from Lake Prespa is a village called Brajčino. This village is an ideal base for people planning to get into Pelister National Park. There are a few marked trails to visit the churches around the village and on the slopes of the Baba mountain. A longer trail head to Pelister’s glacial mountain-top lakes.

When approaching Brajčino, you’ll see a sign to visit the church of St Nikola. As it’s only a few hundred meters, we parked our Skoda and visited the church and it’s cemetery.

We’ve seen most of the highlights of this side of Lake Prespa. Time to move to the other side and find a restaurant over there. We kept driving until the village of Stenje.

  

Except for some garbage, the shore of lake Prespa around the village Stenje is still very beautiful and calm.  The beach is very large comparing the other beaches we’ve seen around Lake Prespa. It has a large platform above the lake. It seems they often have plenty of people here on the beach of Stenje as it is mainly occupied with (empty) white beach chairs.  Maybe most of the local day visitors already left as it was close to dinner time when we arrived. Luckily we still found a free table at the beach side restaurant.

After our dinner we drove over the Livada Pass from Prespa lake towards Ohrid lake and further towards Struga where there should be some calmer camp sites. We found a small campsite called ‘Camping Rino’ on the shore of lake Ohrid where we got a few square meters assigned. The location and the staff of Camping Rino are very great and you get free coffee and shot on arrival.
