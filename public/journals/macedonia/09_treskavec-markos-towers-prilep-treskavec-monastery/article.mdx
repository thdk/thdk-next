title: Treskavec – From Marko’s towers in Prilep to Treskavec Monastery
---

Last night we slept in our tent on the slopes of Marko’s Towers just outside Prilep. Today we will do one of the hikes from out Bradt guide book for Macedonia. From Marko’s towers to the famous Treskavec monastery.

The walk described in out Bradt guide book starts at a rock with the shape of an elephant. We don’t have so much imaginiation but somehow we saw elephants everywhere. I swear we only had one beer yesterday at the Prilep beer festival.

So for all of you, looking for the elephant rock, remember this image:

When you found this rock, look up to the cross and start climbing.

We spent a little too much time and effort on finding this frontal path. So we were already exhausted before the real work had to start.

The trail is marked with red and white paint but you’ve got to find your own way up at the first part climbing several large rocks. Once you get at the bottom of the first ruined tower, the path is obvious and takes you to the other side of the hill. From here you can enter the ruines and make a final climb up to the cross.
