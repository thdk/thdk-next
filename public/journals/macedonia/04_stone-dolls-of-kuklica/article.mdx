title: Goat cheese and Stone dolls of Kuklica

In the morning we could finally see where we ended up last night. The hostel is build on the higher part of the village. It exists of two main buildings. One is for accomodation of guests, the other one is the house of the owner.

The owner just started his business where eventually he’ll have space for over 20 guests.

We walked around the property and finally ended up on this nice swing while waiting for our breakfast.

The owner however, invited us to go with him and milk the goats!

The owner asked me if I wanted to try it myself. Of course! With some instructions I managed not to spoil the full bucket of fresh goat milk. Neither did I got kicked by the goat. So I assume I did a great job.

Meanwhile the neighbour woman arrived with the breakfast. It was a lot, but so delicous! Burek, made especially for us in the early morning with a fresh chopska salad and goat milk yoghurt!

Traveling is more that tasting local food so we continued our trip in Macedonia after the breakfast.

We continued the road towards Veles. Along this road on the right side is a small parking area with a water fountain from where you can see the Monastery of Sv Bogorodica.

From the parking area we took a small path into the gorge. Five minutes later we were both on a long wooden suspension bridge over the river.

Safely on the other side, we found out the church was closed. Appaerently we had to ask for the key in the monastery house just before the church. The man living there had seen us passing by and was already on his way to open the church for us.

We lit our candle in the church and returned to our car. Traffic on the road is only allowed in one direction so we could only continue further north. We left the main road to see the Boat Hotel on the Mladost reservoir.

From here we could see the road for traffic in direction of Skopje and Kumanovo. Unfortunately, it wasn’t so easy to find the entrance of this road. We had to ask people again and again. Sometimes they were explaining for almost ten minutes how we could get there. Eventually we had to follow an old car with three men. Then they stopped at a crossroad where they got into an argument because they couldn’t agree on the correct road themselves. I don’t remember excactly how it happened but suddenly we were on the correct road back in the north direction of Kumanovo.

We couldn’t find something worth visiting in Kumanovo in our Bradt guide book so we head straight to our next site. Still close to Kumanovo, is the site of Zebrnjak. Once a huge tower standing on top of a hill in a flat landscape. Now only the base of this tower is left. Nicely renovated with a small museum inside.

One man lives in a small house next to the monument. He’ll open the museum and gave a small tour inside. We also accepted his offer to stay for a cup of tea.

Then it was already time to start looking for a camp place for the night. The stone dolls of Kukilca sounded very promising in our guide book. It was compared with the famous rock formation of Cappadocia in Turkey. Ideally we would camp close to the stone dolls to be able to photograph both sunset and sunrise.

Of course the stone dolls of Kukilica is a much smaller site than Cappadocia in Turkey, it was still a very nice view. We even got the honor to witness a wedding proposal at the stone dolls site.
