title: Ohrid old town and springs in Vevƒçani
---

This morning I left the hostel around 5pm with the good hope to make some photos in the old town of Ohrid and of Ohrid lake. I drove with our Skoda Fabia from the hostel closer to the city. I parked it at the Upper Gate Parking. Or at least close to the upper parking since I only noticed this parking when I had climbed all the stairs after I thought I had parked the car as close as possible‚Ä¶

When I came at the Church of Saints Clement and Panteleimon I still had to wait a few minutes for the sun to lighten the church just a little more.

I didn‚Äôt wanted to wait for the shadow to disappear completely, as I might be to late make my sunrise photos at the lake itself.

Although I was rushing trough all the narrow streets of the old town of Ohrid, I did notice it was really a beautiful town. Especially in the very early morning. With few people out on the streets and the beautiful light. Not to forget a more comfortable temperature.

On the pier of Ohrid I watched a while how a taxi boat captain prepared his boat. He tried to convince me to join him on a sunrise trip with the boat. Saying that the trip wouldn‚Äôt cost more than a beer in a club in my country. Very attractive, but I had to go back to the hostel where Lada probably was waiting already for me to pick her up.

Ohrid really is the pearl of Macedonia. The Lake and the city. However, finding a place that offers breakfast was not that easy. Finally we found the Gladiator restaurant. Splendid view to have a coffee, tea and delicious Macedonian baklava!

From this point a small path takes you within a minute away of all the other tourists and leads you to the other side of the cliff. Within 15 minutes you can descend to the lake and there is a tiny private beach you might have all for yourself. We had to share this beach with just two other people. But sharing is caring, right?

After we were cooled down by the cool water of lake ohrid, we returned our steps and went to visit the Samuel‚Äôs Fortress. From the fortress walls you get views over the entire city of Ohrid and the lake.

From the castle we went back to our car parked at the Upper Gate and drove towards a small village called Vevƒçani.

After our small walk to the springs and trough the streets of Vevƒçani we arrived in Pupuin‚Äôs House where we had a delicious dinner.

Good to sleep in a nice hotel (Villa Alula) after our uncomfortable stay in a cheap hostel in Ohrid. We will need a good rest as tomorrow we‚Äôll hike the surrounding hills of Vevƒçani!
