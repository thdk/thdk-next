## Pidurangala Rock, the alternative for Sigiriya
Sigiriya rock fortress is a famous in Sri Lanka. It’s often called the 8th world wonder because of the presence of an ancient palace on top of it. Visitors can still climb the steep stairs all the way to the top and see the ruins of the fortress. We didn’t visit the Sigiriya rock, or Lion Rock, itself, but did visit Pidurangala Rock. Pidurangala Rock is a rock nearby Sigiriya but without a palace or fortress. However, you get a stunning view on Sigiriya  from the top of Pidurangala Rock.

## Polonnaruwa
Polonnaruwa is the third ancient city as part of the Cultural Triangle of Sri Lanka. We already visited Kandy and Anuradhapura earlier on our journey. Now, we’ll use the bikes from our guesthouse to tour around through the ruines of Polonnaruwa. It’s also a big site just as Anuradhapura, but much easier to get around by yourself. However, while Anuradhapura is still an active place for worship where many people come with offers, Polonnaruwa is much more passive and mainly ruines.
