Five a.m., time to wake up. We are going on our first safari in Sri Lanka! We picked Wilpattu National Park to make a full day safari. They say you get the best chance of seeing a Leopard in Wilpattu. Let’s find out if that’s true.

A jeep came to pick us up at our guesthouse. Still a bit sleepy and packed with breakfast and luch package we climbed in the back of the jeep. Full of expectations of our first safari.

Our driver was the unlucky man who still had to drive for two hours in heavy monsoon rain towards Anuradhapura. Another ancient city part of the cultural triangle of Sri Lanka. We’ll visit it tomorrow morning. In the afternoon we have planned another safari in Mminneriya to see some more elephants!
