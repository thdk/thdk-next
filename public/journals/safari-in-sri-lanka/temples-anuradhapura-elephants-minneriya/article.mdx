## Anuradhapura
The temples in Anuradhapura are spread all over a big part of the ancient city. You can rent bikes to make it easier or use tuk tuk to get you around. We had our driver who dropped us at several temples and who droves us past other less known places of interest in Anuradhapura. But if you have some time, I think a bike gives you the most flexibility.

Whatever transport you use in Anuradhapura, you’ll need to buy tickets first at a the ticket counter. I’m not sure where else you can buy the day pass, but we bought it inside the archaeology museum.

## Jetavana monastery ruins
Behind the archaeology museum you can find a large area with ruins of the Jetavana monstery. With its most remarquable item the damaged Jethawanaramaya stupa.

At most stupas and temples, signs ask you to remove your shoes and hats and be properly dressed. However, what they don’t tell you is the following:

It is also polite to circumambulate to the right; that is, walk to the left around the object so that your right hand, considered to be the clean hand, is constantly facing the object.

Take the above quote in mind when walking around the stupas.

## Bodhi Tree Temple (The Sri Maha Bodhiya)
The Bodhi Tree Temple, is the second most sacred place in Sri Lanka, after the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy. This tree is a cutting from the original Bodhi tree under which the Buddha gained enlightenment, and has been continuously guarded for over 2000 years, making it the oldest historically authenticated tree in the world.
