footer: The Malerweg continues along the railroad. We didn’t reach Altendorf yet, but the meadow between the railroad and the river was just a great camping spot. The climb to Altendorf can wait one more night.

The third stage of the Malerweg is about 18 km and goes from Hohnstein to Altendorf.

This is the start of our second stay along the Malerweg. We’ll hike again two stages. First from Hohnstein to Altendorf, then the next day to the Neumannmühle. We’ve parked the car along the road near the Neumannmühle and hitchhiked in two rides to Hohnstein. In Hohnstein we easily picked up the Malerweg trail where we had left it earlier in September last year.
