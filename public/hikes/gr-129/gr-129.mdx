The GR 129 is one of the many long distance hiking routes in Europe. The GR 129 is also known as ‘Across Belgium’ (Dutch: Dwars door Belgie; French: La Belgique en diagonale).

The total length of the path is almost 600km and goes all the way from Bruges in the North West to Arlon in the South East of Belgium. The last part of this trail was only recently added in 2012.

The three main parts are:

- Brugge – Ronse / Renaix: 118 km
- Ronse / Renaix – Dinant: 189 km (?)
- Dinant – Arlon: 254km
